# pbrt-rs

Panda Based Ray Tracer (rusty version)

This is an attempt at recreating the PBRT software in Rust.

A learning project for both modern raytracing techniques and Rust language.

Work still in progress, usually on unstable branch.


# Use

So far, the only way to use the program is by running unit tests :

`cargo test`

or, to include a specific test and/or display all debug information,

`cargo test raytracer_import_scene -- --nocapture`
